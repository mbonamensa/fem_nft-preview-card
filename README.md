## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned how to create box shadows in figma, since I created my own figam file from the design images given. I had to do a little research to figure out how to do that. It made coding the actual box shadow easier because figma generated the code.

I also practiced creating image overlays on hover with `flex` and `opacity`

I found out also that the little space under images within a div is because the browser adds some whitespace to adjust for other inline-level elements because `img`. Adding a `display: block;` fixes this issue.

### Continued development

I'll keep learning how to use Figma to create designs.


### Useful resources

- [Apply Shadow or blur effects](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041488473-Apply-shadow-or-blur-effects) - This helped me figure a way to add box shadows to the design.
- [How to remove the extra white space underneath an image using CSS ](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-remove-white-space-under-an-image-using-css.php) - I finally understood why images always had spaces underneath them when inside a div.
